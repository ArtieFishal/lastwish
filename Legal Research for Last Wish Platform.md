## Digital Asset Estate Planning Legal Landscape

### Overview
Almost all 50 states have passed laws that give a person's family (or Executor) the right to access and manage digital assets after they die. This is largely based on the **Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (RUFADAA)** created by the Uniform Law Commission.

### Key Legal Framework: RUFADAA
The Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (2015) is aimed to allow executors, trustees, or court-appointed conservators/fiduciaries complete access to deceased's digital assets.

### Important Considerations
- Even with these laws in place, many accounts are still governed by the "terms of service" or "privacy policy" of particular services
- Companies like Facebook and Google have their own legacy contact and inactive account management systems
- It's recommended to consult a licensed estate attorney in your state for specific guidance

### State-by-State Implementation Status

5. **Witnesses**: Typically 2 witnesses must also sign

### Special Cases

- **All Other States**: Require witness signatures (notarization cannot substitute)

### Codicil Requirements
- Codicils (will amendments) often require notarization for enhanced legal standing
- Same execution requirements as wills in most jurisdictions
- Can be used to add cryptocurrency and digital asset provisions to existing wills

### Cost Considerations
