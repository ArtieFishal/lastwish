Fundamentals of Wills vs. Trusts
Wills
	•	Definition: A legal declaration of how you want your assets distributed after death.
	•	Key Components:
	•	Testator (you), Executor (person you appoint to carry out your wishes), Beneficiaries, and a Residue Clause(disposition of any remaining property).
	•	Guardianship provisions for minor children.
	•	Digital Assets clause (specifying how to handle online accounts, cryptocurrencies, etc.).
	•	Pros & Cons:
	•	Relatively simple and inexpensive to set up.
	•	– Generally must pass through probate, which can be time‑consuming and public.
Trusts
	•	Definition: A legal arrangement in which a Grantor transfers assets into a Trust managed by a Trustee for the benefit of Beneficiaries.
	•	Types:
	•	Revocable Living Trust: You retain control and can amend or revoke it during your lifetime. Helps avoid probate.
	•	Irrevocable Trust: Cannot be easily changed; offers stronger asset protection and potential tax benefits.
	•	Testamentary Trust: Created by your will and comes into effect after death.
	•	Pros & Cons:
	•	Often avoids probate, provides privacy, and allows for detailed control over distribution (e.g., staged inheritances).
	•	– More complex and costly to establish and maintain.

2. Incorporating Digital & Blockchain Assets
Why Plan for Crypto in Your Will/Trust
	•	Control & Access: Without clear instructions, heirs may never recover assets held in private wallets.
	•	Valuation & Conversion: Crypto values fluctuate; decide whether heirs receive assets in kind or liquidated.
Key Provisions to Include
	1.	Identification of Assets: List each wallet address, blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin), and approximate contents.
	2.	Access Instructions:
	•	Where/how to find seed phrases or private keys (e.g., encrypted USB drive, safe deposit box).
	•	Contact details for your Digital Executor—a tech‑savvy person or service.
	3.	Disposition Instructions: Specify whether assets pass outright or into a trust (e.g., “Place 50 ETH into the Smith Family Trust, to be distributed equally at age 25”).

3. Technical Approaches to Blockchain Wallet Management
3.1 Secure Key Storage
	•	Hardware Wallets: Recommend Ledger or Trezor; store hardware in a locked, fire‑resistant location.
	•	Shamir’s Secret Sharing: Split seed phrase into multiple shares; distribute among trusted parties or safety deposit boxes.
	•	Multisignature (Multisig) Wallets: Require multiple private keys (e.g., 2-of-3) to authorize transfers; you can name co‑trustees as co‑signers.
3.2 Automated “Digital Will” Smart Contracts
	•	Dead-Man’s Switch Contracts:
	•	Require periodic “heartbeat” transactions from you; if missed, the contract automatically unlocks funds to designated beneficiaries.
	•	Example: Ethereum smart contract that if no user‑signed transaction for 6 months, releases tokens.
	•	Oracles & Time Locks:
	•	Use a trusted oracle (e.g., Chainlink) to verify your passing (via public death records) and trigger fund release.
	•	Time‑lock functions hold assets until a specified timestamp or event.

4. Integrating with n8n (NAN) Workflows
	1.	Data Collection Form:
	•	Build a web form to gather user details (personal info, asset lists, wallet addresses, wallet types, preferred executors).
	2.	Document Generation:
	•	Use a template engine (e.g., Handlebars) to populate a WILL/TRUST PDF.
	•	Store completed PDFs in a document management service (e.g., AWS S3).
	3.	Key & Secret Handling:
	•	For non‑custodial management, simply record wallet metadata in your database.
	•	If offering key management services, integrate with a secure HSM or Vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) via n8n HTTP nodes.
	4.	Smart Contract Deployment (Optional):
	•	Provide an n8n workflow that, after document execution, calls a blockchain node RPC (via web3.js) to deploy a tailored “inheritance” contract.
	5.	Notification & Updates:
	•	Schedule reminders (e.g., via n8n Cron) for users to “heartbeat” their digital‑will smart contract.
	•	Alert digital executors if a heartbeat is missed.

5. Next Steps & Clarifications
To tailor guidance further, could you let me know:
	•	Jurisdiction(s): Which country or state’s laws will your users be subject to?
	•	Blockchain Focus: Are you targeting specific networks (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana)?
	•	Custodial vs. Non‑Custodial: Will your platform hold keys on behalf of users or merely record instructions in their wills/trusts?
With that information, I can help you design specific legal‑tech workflows, suggest document clauses compatible with local law, and outline the exact n8n integrations you’ll need.
