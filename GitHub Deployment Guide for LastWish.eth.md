## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Deploy to Existing Repository with New Branch

Since you already have a `lastwish` repository, we'll create a new branch for this version:

#### 1. Push New Branch to Existing Repository
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /home/ubuntu/lastwish-vxndzzgq

# The repository is already configured with:
# - Remote origin pointing to your existing lastwish repository
# - New branch 'vxndzzgq-demo' created and checked out

# Push the new branch to GitHub
git push -u origin vxndzzgq-demo
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username in the remote URL**

#### 2. Update Remote URL (if needed)
If your GitHub username is different, update the remote:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_ACTUAL_USERNAME/lastwish.git
```

### Option 2: Upload Files Manually

If you prefer not to use Git commands:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (same as above)
2. Download the project zip file from our previous conversation
3. Extract the files locally
4. Use GitHub's web interface to upload files:
   - Click **"uploading an existing file"**
   - Drag and drop all project files
   - Commit the files

## GitHub Pages Deployment Options

### Option 1: Deploy Branch to GitHub Pages

You can deploy the `vxndzzgq-demo` branch directly to GitHub Pages:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages for Branch:**
   - Go to your repository → **Settings** tab
   - Scroll to **"Pages"** section (left sidebar)
   - Under **"Source"**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - Choose **"vxndzzgq-demo"** branch and **"/ (root)"** folder
   - Save the settings
   - Your demo will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/lastwish`

### Option 2: GitHub Actions Deployment

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment:

1. **Modify Workflow (if needed):**
   - The workflow is set to trigger on `main` branch
   - You can modify `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to trigger on `vxndzzgq-demo` branch
   - Or merge this branch to `main` when ready

2. **Enable GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to your repository → **Settings** tab → **Pages**
   - Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - The workflow will deploy automatically on push

### Option 3: Create Separate Demo Site

For a dedicated demo deployment:

1. **Create GitHub Pages from Branch:**
   - Deploy `vxndzzgq-demo` branch to GitHub Pages
   - Access at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/lastwish`
   - This becomes your live demo while keeping main branch separate

## Required Configuration

### API Keys Setup

Before the application is fully functional, you need to configure API keys:

#### 1. Get Moralis API Key
1. Visit [moralis.io](https://moralis.io/)
2. Create a free account
3. Go to **"Web3 APIs"** section
4. Create a new project
5. Copy your API key

#### 2. Get WalletConnect Project ID
1. Visit [cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/)
2. Create an account
3. Create a new project
4. Copy your Project ID

#### 3. Update Configuration
Edit `src/config.js` in your repository:

```javascript
window.LASTWISH_CONFIG = {
  chainId: 1,
  payToAddress: "0x016ae25Ac494B123C40EDb2418d9b1FC2d62279b",
  payAmountEth: 0.0001,
  ensDiscountPercent: 20,
  n8nWebhookUrl: "",
  moralisApiKey: "YOUR_ACTUAL_MORALIS_API_KEY_HERE",
  walletConnectProjectId: "YOUR_ACTUAL_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID_HERE"
};
```

**⚠️ Security Note**: For production, consider using GitHub Secrets and environment variables instead of hardcoding API keys.

## Authentication Options for Git Push

### Option A: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. **Generate Token:**
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
   - Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - Copy the generated token

2. **Use Token:**
   - When prompted for password during `git push`, use the token instead
   - Username: your GitHub username
   - Password: the personal access token

### Option B: GitHub CLI

1. **Install GitHub CLI** (if not already installed)
2. **Authenticate:**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
3. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option C: SSH Key

1. **Generate SSH Key:**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
2. **Add to GitHub:**
   - Copy the public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
   - Paste the key and save
3. **Update Remote URL:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/lastwish-eth.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

**Solution**:
- Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment to complete
- Check Actions tab for deployment status
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Verify the correct source is selected

#### API Keys Not Working
**Problem**: Assets don't load, wallet connection fails
**Solution**:
- Verify API keys are correctly copied
- Check for extra spaces or characters
- Ensure Moralis project is active

#### Console Errors
**Problem**: JavaScript errors in browser console
**Solution**:
- Check if all files uploaded correctly
- Verify file paths in HTML are correct
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled for GitHub Pages

## Advanced Deployment Options

### Custom Domain

To use a custom domain with GitHub Pages:

1. **Add CNAME file:**
   ```bash
   echo "yourdomain.com" > CNAME
   git add CNAME
   git commit -m "Add custom domain"
   git push
   ```

2. **Configure DNS:**
   - Add CNAME record pointing to `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`
   - Or add A records pointing to GitHub Pages IPs

3. **Enable HTTPS:**
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Check "Enforce HTTPS"

### IPFS Deployment (Decentralized)

For fully decentralized hosting:

1. **Install IPFS CLI**
